        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        <p>
            To set up Acoustats, you must first create a Last.fm account. To
            create a Last.fm account, go to
            <a
                href="https://www.last.fm/join"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >this link</a
            >
            and follow the instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
            After you create your account, go to Last.fm's
            <a
                href="https://www.last.fm/about/trackmymusic#spotify"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Track My Music page</a
            >, scroll down to the section for your platform and follow the
            instructions to configure your media platform of choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an example, for Spotify, scroll down to Spotify, and click
            "Connect", then follow the instructions to link your Spotify
            account.
        </p>
        <p>
            After your media platform is linked, start listening to music. After
            you start listening, Acoustats (through Last.fm) will be able to
            access your listening history. At any time, if you want to check
            what listening history Last.fm and Acoustats can see, go to your
            Last.fm profile from either the
            <a
                href="https://www.last.fm/home"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >homepage</a
            >
            (hovering over your profile picture, then clicking "View Profile")
            or by going to
            <code>https://www.last.fm/user/YOUR_LASTFM_USERNAME</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>Setting Up Acoustats</h3>
        <p>
            If you want to use a community version of Acoustats, join the
            <a
                href="https://discord.gg/vSbKaB8wk3"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >HK Development Discord server</a
            >
            and go to the <code>#music-analyzer-commands</code> channel. In that
            channel, first tell the bot what your Last.fm username is by using
            the <code>/set-lastfm-username</code> slash command, passing your
            username to the prompt.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you wish to self-host the analyzer and/or bot, follow the
            instructions in
            <a
                href="https://github.com/hkamran80/music-analyzer"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
            >
                the GitHub repository</a
            >.
        </p>

        <h3>Using Acoustats</h3>
        <p>
            To use Acoustats, all you have to do is go into a channel (or you
            can DM the bot) with a command. The following commands are
            available.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>/get-all-stats</code>: Get all your listening statistics
                for a given time period
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>/get-top-tracks</code>: Get your top tracks for a given
                time period
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>/get-top-artists</code>: Get your top artists for a given
                time period
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>/get-duration</code>: Get your listening duration for a
                given time period
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>/get-track-count</code>: Get the amount of tracks you
                listened to in a given time period
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Regarding Track Durations</h4>
        <p>
            Due to the way Last.fm provides track data, the duration that is
            listed may not be the exact duration. Attempts have been taken to
            circumvent those issues, but nevertheless, some tracks do not have
            durations.
